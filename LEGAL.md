# Legal & Compliance

## ⚖️ Legal Framework

KnowTon provides blockchain-based tools and infrastructure to assist with intellectual property management. **Important**: On-chain records do not automatically constitute complete legal transfer of rights or official copyright registration.

### Key Legal Principles

1. **Intellectual Property Rights**
   - Uploaders must declare and warrant they own or have rights to uploaded content
   - Platform facilitates licensing and transfer agreements
   - Blockchain records serve as evidence, not replacement for legal documentation

2. **Licensing vs. Transfer**
   - **License**: Grants specific usage rights while creator retains ownership
   - **Transfer**: Full ownership transfer (requires explicit legal agreement)
   - All transactions require signed electronic agreements

3. **Jurisdictional Compliance**
   - Platform operates under applicable laws in each jurisdiction
   - Users responsible for compliance with local regulations
   - Cross-border transactions subject to international IP law
