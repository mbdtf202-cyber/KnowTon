## Requirements Mapping

This implementation addresses the following requirements from the design document:

### Requirement 13.1: Staking Mechanism
- ‚úÖ Users can stake platform governance tokens
- ‚úÖ Minimum lock period of 30 days
- ‚úÖ Staking rewards calculation

### Requirement 13.2: Reward Calculation
- ‚úÖ APY-based reward calculation (8-20%)
- ‚úÖ Dynamic APY based on total staked amount
- ‚úÖ Lock period bonuses

### Requirement 13.3: Liquidity Pool Integration
- ‚úÖ Trading fee distribution to stakers
- ‚úÖ Proportional reward distribution
- üîÑ Actual liquidity pool integration pending

### Requirement 13.4: Liquidity Mining
- ‚úÖ Token distribution mechanism
- ‚úÖ Incentive for early liquidity providers
- üîÑ Actual mining program pending

### Requirement 13.5: Unstaking Process
- ‚úÖ 7-day unbonding period
- ‚úÖ Token lock during unbonding
- ‚úÖ Unstake button enabled after lock period

## Smart Contract Integration

### Current Status: Mock Implementation
The current implementation uses mock data and simulated transactions. The following contract calls need to be implemented:

### Required Contract Calls:

1. **Staking Contract (`IStakingRewards`)**
   ```typescript
   // Stake tokens
   stake(amount: BigNumber, lockPeriod: number): Promise<Transaction>
   
   // Unstake tokens
   unstake(stakeId: BigNumber): Promise<Transaction>
   
   // Claim rewards
   claimRewards(stakeId: BigNumber): Promise<Transaction>
   
   // Get staking stats
   getTotalStaked(): Promise<BigNumber>
   getRewardRate(): Promise<BigNumber>
   getAPY(): Promise<number>
   
   // Get user data
   getStakeInfo(stakeId: BigNumber): Promise<StakeInfo>
   getUserStakes(address: string): Promise<StakeInfo[]>
   calculateRewards(stakeId: BigNumber): Promise<BigNumber>
   ```

2. **Token Contract (ERC-20)**
   ```typescript
   // Approve staking contract
   approve(spender: string, amount: BigNumber): Promise<Transaction>
   
   // Get balance
   balanceOf(address: string): Promise<BigNumber>
   ```

### Integration Steps:

1. Import contract ABIs and addresses
2. Initialize contract instances with ethers.js/wagmi
3. Replace mock calls in `useStaking.ts` with actual contract calls
4. Add proper error handling for contract errors
5. Implement transaction confirmation waiting
6. Add gas estimation and optimization

## Styling

The implementation uses Tailwind CSS with the following design principles:

- **Color Scheme:**
  - Blue: Primary actions and active states
  - Purple: Secondary highlights
  - Green: Success states and rewards
  - Orange: Pending rewards
  - Red: Warnings and unstake actions
  - Yellow: Important notices

- **Layout:**
  - Responsive grid system
  - Card-based design
  - Clear visual hierarchy
  - Consistent spacing

- **Components:**
  - Rounded corners (rounded-lg)
  - Subtle shadows (shadow-sm)
  - Gradient backgrounds for emphasis
  - Smooth transitions

## User Experience

### Staking Flow:
1. User connects wallet
2. Views staking statistics
3. Enters amount to stake
4. Selects lock period
5. Reviews estimated rewards
6. Confirms transaction
7. Waits for confirmation
8. Views updated stake in history

### Unstaking Flow:
1. User views stake history
2. Checks if stake is unlocked
3. Clicks unstake button
4. Confirms transaction
5. Waits for 7-day unbonding period
6. Receives tokens back

### Claiming Rewards Flow:
1. User views pending rewards
2. Clicks claim button
3. Confirms transaction
4. Receives rewards in wallet

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- Wallet not connected
- Insufficient balance
- Invalid input amounts
- Transaction rejection
- Network errors
- Contract errors

Each error displays a user-friendly message with appropriate actions.

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests:
- Hook state management
- Reward calculation logic
- Form validation
- Component rendering

### Integration Tests:
- Complete staking flow
- Unstaking after lock period
- Claiming rewards
- Error scenarios

### E2E Tests:
- Full user journey
- Wallet connection
- Transaction confirmation
- State updates

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Features:**
   - Auto-compound rewards
   - Flexible unstaking with penalties
   - Staking pools with different strategies
   - NFT staking support

2. **Analytics:**
   - Historical APY charts
   - Rewards history graph
   - Staking distribution visualization
   - Comparative analytics

3. **Governance Integration:**
   - Voting power display
   - Active proposals
   - Voting from staking page
   - Delegation options

4. **Mobile Optimization:**
   - Touch-friendly controls
   - Simplified mobile layout
   - Progressive web app features

## Dependencies
