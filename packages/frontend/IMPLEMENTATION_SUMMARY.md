## Task: 实现创作者注册页面 (Creator Registration Page)

### Status: ✅ Completed

## Implementation Overview

Successfully implemented a complete creator registration system for the KnowTon platform, including form components, API integration, DID creation flow, and state management.

## Files Created

### 1. Main Page Component
**File**: `packages/frontend/src/pages/RegisterPage.tsx`
- Main registration page with wallet connection check
- Progress tracking and error handling
- Integration with custom hook and form component

### 2. Reusable Form Component
**File**: `packages/frontend/src/components/CreatorRegistrationForm.tsx`
- Modular registration form with all required fields
- Real-time validation and error display
- Avatar upload with preview
- Social media links input
- Exports validation function and TypeScript interfaces

### 3. Custom Hook
**File**: `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useCreatorRegistration.ts`
- Encapsulates all registration logic
- Manages form state and validation
- Handles API calls and error handling
- Tracks registration progress (0-100%)
- Integrates with wallet signing

### 4. API Service Layer
**File**: `packages/frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- Centralized API client with error handling
- Creator API methods (register, createDID, getProfile, updateProfile)
- Content API methods (uploadToIPFS, getMetadata)
- NFT API methods (mint, getDetails, getUserNFTs)
- Marketplace API methods (orderbook, orders)
- Analytics API methods

### 5. Documentation
**File**: `packages/frontend/src/pages/RegisterPage.README.md`
- Comprehensive documentation of the registration feature
- Component descriptions and API references
- Validation rules and error handling
- User flow diagrams
- Testing considerations

## Files Modified

### 1. App Router
**File**: `packages/frontend/src/App.tsx`
- Added `/register` route
- Imported RegisterPage component

### 2. Home Page
**File**: `packages/frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx`
- Added navigation to registration page
- Wallet connection check before registration
- Updated "开始创作" button with handler

### 3. App Store
**File**: `packages/frontend/src/store/useAppStore.ts`
- Updated User type import from types file
- Ensures consistency across the application

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Registration Form Component
- Username input with validation (3-30 chars, alphanumeric + _-)
- Bio textarea with character counter (10-500 chars)
- Email input with format validation (optional)
- Avatar upload with preview (max 10MB, image formats)
- Social links: Twitter/X, Discord, Website (all optional)
- Real-time validation with error messages
- Disabled state during submission

### ✅ Avatar Upload
- File input with image format restriction
- Real-time preview using FileReader API
- File size validation (10MB limit)
- Upload to IPFS via Content Service API
- Returns IPFS CID for storage

### ✅ Creator Service API Integration
- POST `/api/v1/creators/register` - Register new creator
- POST `/api/v1/creators/did` - Create DID via Ceramic Network
- POST `/api/v1/content/upload` - Upload files to IPFS
- Proper error handling with custom APIError class
- Type-safe API methods with TypeScript

### ✅ DID Creation Flow
Complete 5-step registration process:

1. **Sign Message (20%)**: User signs authentication message with wallet
2. **Upload Avatar (40%)**: Optional avatar upload to IPFS
3. **Create DID (60%)**: Generate decentralized identity via Ceramic
4. **Register Creator (80%)**: Submit all data to backend
5. **Update State (100%)**: Update local app state and navigate to profile

Progress tracking with visual feedback and status messages.

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Patterns
- **Separation of Concerns**: Logic (hook), UI (component), API (service)
- **Reusability**: Form component can be reused for profile editing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with custom error class
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, local state for form

### Validation
- Client-side validation before submission
- Field-specific error messages
- Real-time feedback for character limits
- URL format validation for social links
- File type and size validation for avatar

### User Experience
- Clear progress indication (0-100%)
- Step-by-step status messages
- Disabled form during submission
- Avatar preview before upload
- Wallet address display
- Cancel and submit buttons
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### API Integration
- Centralized API service layer
- Type-safe request/response handling
- Custom APIError class for error handling
- Proper HTTP methods and headers
- FormData for file uploads

## Requirements Satisfied

### ✅ Requirement 1.1: Web3 Wallet Connection
- Wallet signature verification (SIWE pattern)
- Message signing for authentication
- Address validation and display

### ✅ Requirement 1.2: Decentralized Identity
- DID creation via Ceramic Network
- Integration with Creator Service API
- DID storage in user profile

## Testing Status

### Build Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Vite build completed successfully
- ⚠️ Bundle size warnings (expected for Web3 dependencies)

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Wallet connection flow
- [ ] Form validation
- [ ] Avatar upload to IPFS
- [ ] DID creation
- [ ] Creator registration
- [ ] Navigation to profile
- [ ] Error handling scenarios

## Integration Points

### Backend Services Required
1. **Creator Service** at `${API_BASE_URL}/creators`
   - POST `/register` - Register creator
   - POST `/did` - Create DID

2. **Content Service** at `${API_BASE_URL}/content`
   - POST `/upload` - Upload to IPFS

3. **IPFS Gateway** - For avatar storage

4. **Ceramic Network** - For DID creation

### Frontend Dependencies
- React Router for navigation
- Wagmi for wallet integration
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Test registration flow with backend services
2. Verify IPFS upload functionality
3. Test DID creation with Ceramic Network
4. Validate error handling scenarios

### Future Enhancements
1. Add email verification flow
2. Implement username availability check
3. Add profile preview before submission
4. Support avatar cropping/editing
5. Add multi-step form wizard
6. Implement draft saving
7. Add social media verification
8. Support rich text in bio field
