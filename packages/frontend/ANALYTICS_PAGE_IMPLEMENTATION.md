Main analytics dashboard page that orchestrates all analytics components.

**Features:**
- Time range selector (7d, 30d, 90d, 1y)
- Wallet connection check
- Integration of all analytics components
- Content selection state management

**Props:**
- None (uses wagmi hooks for wallet connection)

**State:**
- `timeRange`: Selected time period for analytics
- `selectedContent`: Currently selected content for detailed view

### 2. AnalyticsSummary (`src/components/AnalyticsSummary.tsx`)
Displays key performance metrics in card format.

**Features:**
- Four summary metric cards:
  - Total Revenue (üí∞)
  - Total Views (üëÅÔ∏è)
  - Content Count (üìÅ)
  - Average Engagement Rate (‚ù§Ô∏è)
- Percentage change indicators with up/down arrows
- Loading skeleton states
- Responsive grid layout

**Props:**
- `address`: Creator wallet address
- `timeRange`: Time period for metrics

### 3. RevenueChart (`src/components/RevenueChart.tsx`)

- Line chart and bar chart toggle
- SVG-based custom chart rendering
- Revenue breakdown (total, royalties, sales)
- Hover tooltips on data points
- Grid lines and axis labels
- Total and average revenue display
- Responsive design

**Props:**
- `address`: Creator wallet address
- `timeRange`: Time period for chart data

**Chart Types:**
- Line chart: Shows revenue trends over time
- Bar chart: Shows revenue distribution by period

### 4. ContentPerformance (`src/components/ContentPerformance.tsx`)
Detailed content metrics and performance tracking.

**Features:**
- Sortable content list (by revenue, views, engagement)
- Content cards with thumbnails
- Key metrics per content:
  - Views, likes, shares
  - Revenue and royalties
  - Sales count and average price
  - Holder count
  - Engagement rate with progress bar
- Expandable details view
- Revenue breakdown (royalties vs sales)
- Empty state handling

**Props:**
- `address`: Creator wallet address
- `timeRange`: Time period for metrics
- `selectedContent`: Currently selected content ID
- `onSelectContent`: Callback for content selection

### 5. ReportExport (`src/components/ReportExport.tsx`)
Export functionality for analytics reports.

**Features:**
- Multiple export formats:
  - CSV: Tabular data export
  - PDF: Formatted report (text-based mock)
  - JSON: Raw data export
- Dropdown menu for format selection
- Loading state during export
- Automatic file download
- Error handling

**Props:**
- `address`: Creator wallet address
- `timeRange`: Time period for report

**Export Process:**
1. User selects export format
2. Data is fetched and formatted
3. Blob is created with appropriate MIME type
4. Browser download is triggered
5. File is named with address and time range

## Custom Hook

### useAnalytics (`src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts`)
Centralized hook for all analytics data fetching.

**Functions:**

1. **getSummaryMetrics(address, timeRange)**
   - Returns: Array of summary metrics with labels, values, changes, and icons
   - Mock data includes: revenue, views, content count, engagement

2. **getRevenueData(address, timeRange)**
   - Returns: Array of revenue data points by date
   - Includes: date, revenue, royalties, sales

3. **getContentMetrics(address, timeRange)**
   - Returns: Array of content performance metrics
   - Includes: tokenId, title, category, views, revenue, engagement, etc.

4. **exportReport(address, timeRange, format)**
   - Returns: Blob for file download
   - Formats: CSV, PDF, JSON
   - Generates formatted report data

**State:**
- `loading`: Loading state for async operations
- `error`: Error message if operations fail

## Data Flow

```
AnalyticsPage
  ‚îú‚îÄ> AnalyticsSummary
  ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ> useAnalytics.getSummaryMetrics()
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ> RevenueChart
  ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ> useAnalytics.getRevenueData()
  ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ> ReportExport
  ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ> useAnalytics.exportReport()
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ> ContentPerformance
        ‚îî‚îÄ> useAnalytics.getContentMetrics()
```

## Routing

Added route in `App.tsx`:
```tsx
<Route path="/analytics" element={<AnalyticsPage />} />
```

Added navigation link in `Header.tsx`:
```tsx
<Link to="/analytics">ÂàÜÊûê</Link>
```

## Styling

All components use Tailwind CSS with consistent design patterns:
- Card-based layouts with shadows and borders
- Blue color scheme (#3b82f6) for primary actions
- Gray scale for text hierarchy
- Hover states and transitions
- Responsive grid layouts
- Loading skeletons for better UX

## Mock Data

Currently using mock data for demonstration. In production, replace with actual API calls:

```typescript
// Example production implementation
const getRevenueData = async (address: string, timeRange: string) => {
  const response = await api.get(`/analytics/${address}/revenue`, {
    params: { timeRange }
  })
  return response.data
}
```

## Requirements Mapping

This implementation addresses the following requirements from the design document:

- **11.1**: Real-time metrics including trading volume, floor price, holder distribution
- **11.2**: 24-hour price change, 7-day trading volume, total value locked
- **11.3**: Annual percentage yield calculations and portfolio analysis
- **11.4**: Price charts with multiple view types (candlestick, line, area)
- **11.5**: Unrealized gains, realized profits, and performance tracking

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data
2. **Advanced Charts**: Integration with Chart.js or Recharts
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare performance across multiple contents
4. **Predictive Analytics**: ML-based revenue forecasting
5. **Custom Date Ranges**: Allow users to select specific date ranges
6. **Dashboard Customization**: Drag-and-drop widget arrangement
7. **Alerts**: Set up performance alerts and notifications
8. **Social Sharing**: Share analytics snapshots on social media

## Testing Considerations

When implementing tests:
1. Test data fetching and loading states
2. Test chart rendering with various data sets
3. Test export functionality for all formats
4. Test sorting and filtering in ContentPerformance
5. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
6. Test error handling and empty states

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Memoization**: Use React.memo for expensive components
2. **Lazy Loading**: Code split analytics page
3. **Data Caching**: Cache analytics data with SWR or React Query
4. **Virtualization**: For large content lists
5. **Debouncing**: For sort and filter operations

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance
- Screen reader friendly chart descriptions

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and compatible with:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Dependencies

No additional dependencies required beyond existing project setup:
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- wagmi (for wallet integration)
- React Router (for navigation)

## Conclusion

The Analytics Dashboard provides creators with comprehensive insights into their content performance and revenue streams. The modular component architecture allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements. The mock data implementation can be easily replaced with real API calls when backend services are available.
