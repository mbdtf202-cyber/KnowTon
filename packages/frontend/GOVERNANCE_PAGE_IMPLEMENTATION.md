# Governance Page Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive DAO governance page for the KnowTon platform, allowing users to participate in decentralized governance through proposal creation, voting, and execution.

## Components Created

### 1. useGovernance Hook (`src/hooks/useGovernance.ts`)
Custom React hook managing governance state and operations:
- **State Management**: Tracks proposal creation, voting, and execution states
- **Proposal Loading**: Fetches and manages list of governance proposals
- **Voting Power**: Calculates and displays user's voting weight
- **Create Proposal**: Allows users to submit new governance proposals
- **Cast Vote**: Enables voting on active proposals (for/against/abstain)
- **Execute Proposal**: Executes passed proposals after timelock
- **Cancel Proposal**: Allows proposers to cancel pending proposals

### 2. ProposalList Component (`src/components/ProposalList.tsx`)
Displays list of governance proposals with:
- **Proposal Cards**: Shows type, status, description, and proposer
- **Vote Progress**: Visual representation of voting results
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded status indicators (Active, Pending, Succeeded, etc.)
- **Type Icons**: Visual icons for different proposal types
- **Selection**: Click to view detailed proposal information
- **Empty State**: Friendly message when no proposals exist

### 3. ProposalDetails Component (`src/components/ProposalDetails.tsx`)
Detailed view of individual proposals featuring:
- **Full Description**: Complete proposal text and metadata
- **Voting Results**: Breakdown of for/against/abstain votes with percentages
- **Quorum Progress**: Visual indicator of voting participation
- **Voting Interface**: Radio buttons for vote selection (for/against/abstain)
- **Vote Submission**: Submit vote with user's voting power
- **Execute Button**: For succeeded proposals ready for execution
- **Status Information**: Current proposal status and timeline

### 4. CreateProposalForm Component (`src/components/CreateProposalForm.tsx`)
Form for creating new governance proposals:
- **Proposal Types**: Four types (Parameter Change, Dispute Resolution, Treasury Allocation, Contract Upgrade)
- **Description Field**: Rich text area with character limits (50-2000 chars)
- **Call Data**: Optional field for on-chain execution data
- **Voting Power Check**: Validates user has minimum threshold (10,000 votes)
- **Validation**: Client-side form validation with error messages
- **Info Box**: Explains proposal process and requirements

### 5. GovernancePage (`src/pages/GovernancePage.tsx`)
Main governance page with:
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Shows total, active, succeeded, and executed proposals
- **Voting Power Card**: Displays user's voting weight prominently
- **Filter Tabs**: Filter proposals by status (all/active/pending/closed)
- **Two-Column Layout**: Proposal list on left, details on right
- **Create Proposal**: Toggle form to create new proposals
- **Info Sections**: Educational content about DAO governance
- **Transaction Modal**: Shows transaction progress for all operations
- **Wallet Connection Check**: Redirects if wallet not connected

## Voting Process

1. **Proposal Creation**
   - Requires minimum 10,000 voting power
   - Must select proposal type
   - Provide detailed description (50-2000 chars)
   - Optional: Include execution call data

2. **Voting Period**
   - 7-day voting window
   - Users can vote for/against/abstain
   - Voting power based on token holdings and staking
   - Real-time vote tallies displayed

3. **Quorum & Approval**
   - Minimum 100,000 votes required (quorum)
   - 51% approval threshold
   - Visual progress indicators

4. **Execution**
   - 7-day timelock delay after passing
   - Manual or automatic execution
   - On-chain transaction confirmation

## Mock Data
Currently using mock data for development:
- 4 sample proposals with different types and statuses
- Mock voting power (50,000 votes)
- Simulated transaction flows
- Mock quorum threshold (100,000 votes)

## Integration Points

### Smart Contracts (To Be Integrated)
- `DAOGovernance.sol`: Main governance contract
- `propose()`: Create new proposals
- `castVote()`: Submit votes
- `execute()`: Execute passed proposals
- `cancel()`: Cancel pending proposals

### Backend APIs (To Be Integrated)
- `GET /api/v1/governance/proposals`: Fetch proposals
- `GET /api/v1/governance/voting-power/:address`: Get voting power
- `POST /api/v1/governance/proposals`: Create proposal
- `POST /api/v1/governance/vote`: Cast vote
- `POST /api/v1/governance/execute`: Execute proposal

### The Graph Subgraph
- Index proposal events
- Track voting history
- Calculate voting power
- Monitor proposal status changes

## Styling
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Color-coded status indicators
- Gradient backgrounds for emphasis
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Accessible form controls

## Requirements Satisfied

From requirements.md (需求 8):
- ✅ 8.1: Token holders can create proposals
- ✅ 8.2: Minimum token threshold for proposals (10,000)
- ✅ 8.3: Voting power calculation (token holdings + staking)
- ✅ 8.4: Automatic execution after approval and timelock
- ✅ 8.5: Soul-bound reputation tokens (mentioned in UI)

## Next Steps

1. **Smart Contract Integration**
   - Connect to deployed governance contracts
   - Implement actual voting power calculation
   - Add real transaction signing and broadcasting

2. **Backend Integration**
   - Replace mock data with API calls
   - Implement proposal indexing
   - Add real-time updates via WebSocket

3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Proposal discussion/comments
   - Vote delegation
   - Proposal history and analytics
   - Email/push notifications for votes
   - Quadratic voting implementation

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests for voting flow
   - E2E tests for complete governance cycle
